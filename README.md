**Abstract**

This work investigates the intricate relationship between the q-boson
model, a quantum integrable system, and classical integrable systems
such as the Toda and KP hierarchies. Initially, we analyze scalar
products of off-shell Bethe states and explore their connections to
tau functions of integrable hierarchies. Furthermore, we discuss
correlation functions within this formalism, examining their
representations in terms of tau functions, as well as their Schur
polynomial expansions.
