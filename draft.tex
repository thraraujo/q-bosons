\section{Phase Model and q-Bosons}
%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*

This section introduces the \(q\)-boson and phase
models~\cite{Bogoliubov:1992, Bogoliubov:1997soj, Bogoliubov2005,
  Bogoliubov:1997soj, Tsilevich:2006}, and consists of a general
review of the literature. Consequently, there is nothing particularly
original, except its presentation.  In spite of that, I believe that
it has some pedagoginal value, and a good collection of references.
Here we follow some conventions of~\cite{Wheeler:2010vmq}, but with a
presentation that is closer to~\cite{Tsilevich:2006}.

\subsection{Phase model}
Consider the \((M+1)\) set of operators \(\{\phi_i,
\phi^\dagger,\mathcal{N}_i\}_{i=0}^M\) such that
\begin{equation}
 [\mathcal{N}_i, \phi_j] = - \phi_i \delta_{i,j} \quad
 [\mathcal{N}_i, \phi_j^\dagger] =  \phi_i^\dagger \delta_{i,j}  \quad 
 [\phi_i, \phi_j^\dagger] =  \pi_i \delta_{i,j}  
\end{equation}
where \(\pi_i =(\ket{0} \bra{0})_i\) is the vacuum projection operator.
These operators can be written as
\begin{equation}
\phi = \sum_{n\geq 0}\ket{n}\bra{n+1}\quad 
\phi^\dagger = \sum_{n\geq 0}\ket{n+1}\bra{n} \quad 
N = \sum_{n\geq 0}n\ket{n}\bra{n}\; ,
\end{equation}
and it is easy to see that \(\phi^\dagger \phi = \bm{1} - \ket{0}
\ket{0}\) and \(\phi\phi^\dagger = \bm{1}\).

The Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{equation}
  H = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n =0}^M \left(\phi_n^\dagger \phi_{n+1}
  + \phi_n \phi_{n+1}^\dagger \right) + \bar{\mathcal{N}}\; .
\end{equation}
where \(\bar{\mathcal{N}} = \sum_{i=0}^M \mathcal{N}_i\), and
periodic boundary conditions \(\phi_{M+1} = \phi_0\) and
\(\phi_{M+1}^\dagger = \phi_0^\dagger\).

These operators appear in the context of quantum optics, and for
this reason it is referred as the \emph{phase model}. It 
corresponds to the strongly correlated \(q\)-bosons
model~\cite{Bogoliubov:1997soj} the we will define soon.

\subsubsection{Partitions representation}
Let us define the i\(^{th}\)-vacuum \(\ket{0}_i\) by the the conditions 
\(\phi_i\ket{0}_i\). The representation of this Hilbert space, denoted by
\(\mathcal{F}_i\), is given by \(\ket{n_i}_i = \phi_i^\dagger \ket{0}_i\). 

Given the vacuum \(\ket{\bm{0}} = \ket{0}_0\otimes \ket{0}_1
\otimes \cdots \otimes  \ket{0}_M\),
the Fock space is defined as 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F} = \bigotimes_{i=0}^M \mathcal{F}_i = 
  \left\{\ket{\vec{n}} = \ket{n_0}\otimes \ket{n_1} \otimes \cdots
  \otimes \ket{n_M} \ | \ n_i \in \mathbb{N} \right\}\; .
\end{equation}
where the states \(\ket{\vec{n}}\) are defined as 
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\vec{n}} = \ket{n_0}\otimes \ket{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \ket{n_M} 
 : =  (\phi_0^\dagger)^{n_0} (\phi_1^\dagger)^{n_1} \cdots  (\phi_M^\dagger)^{n_M} \ket{\bm{0}} \; ,
\end{equation}
where we write \(\phi_i^\dagger \equiv \bm{1} \otimes  \cdots \otimes
\phi_i^\dagger \otimes \cdots \otimes \bm{1}\).
We will assume that these states are normalized, that is
\(\bracket{\vec{n}}{\vec{m}}=\delta_{\vec{n}, \vec{m}}\). 

Finally, the actions of the operators \(\mathcal{N}_i\) and \(\pi_i\) are
\begin{equation}
    \pi_i\ket{\vec{n}}  = \delta_{n_i, 0} \ket{\vec{n}} \qquad 
    \mathcal{N}_i\ket{\vec{n}} = n_i \ket{\vec{n}}\; .
\end{equation}
 
Given a state \(\ket{\vec{n}} = \ket{n_0, n_1, \dots, n_M}\), we
associate a partition \( \lambda = (0^{n_0} 1^{n_1} 2^{n_2} \cdots
M^{n_M})\). Observe that this correspondence is not unique, since the
partition \(\lambda\) ignores the number \(n_0\) of particles in the
site \(0\). From the total number of particles, we can, on the other hand,
determine the number of particles \(n_0 = N - \ell(\lambda)\), where
\(\ell(\lambda)\) is the number of rows in the Young diagram defined
by \(\lambda\). This is very important, since in our consideations 
below, the \(N\) particle sector is fixed, thanks to the integrability of 
the model, therefore, the number \(n_0\) is known once we define the 
partition \(\lambda\). 

In fact, from the correspondence above, Wheeler~\cite{Wheeler:2010vmq}
defines a map \(\mathcal{M}_\psi: \mathcal{F}\to
\mathcal{F}^{(0)}_\psi\), where \(\mathcal{F}^{(0)}_\psi\) is the
space Fock space of charged free fermions built upon the neutral
(fermionic) vacuum. We will discuss a map from the bosonic space to
the space of symmetric functions.

\subsubsection{Bethe Ansatz}
The \(L\)-matrix is given by 
\begin{equation}
  L_{an} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
x^{ - 1/2} & \phi_n^\dagger \\ \phi_n & x^{1/2}
\end{pmatrix}_a\; , 
\end{equation}
from where we can build the monodromy matrix 
\begin{equation}
  T_a(x) = L_{aM}(x) \cdots L_{a0}(x) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
A(x) & B(x) \\ C(x) & D(x)
\end{pmatrix}_a\; .
\end{equation}

With these expressions, one can finally build the Bethe states and their dual 
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\widehat{\Psi}(y_1, \dots, y_N)} = \prod_{j=1}^N B(y_j) \ket{\bm{0}}\qquad 
  \bra{\widehat{\Psi}(y_1, \dots, y_N)} = \bra{\bm{0}}\prod_{j=1}^N C(y_j) \; .
\end{equation}
When the set \(\{ y_j \ | \ j =1, \dots , N\}\) satisfies the Bethe equations 
\begin{equation}
  y^{N + M}_i = (-1)^{N-1} \prod_{\substack{j = 1 \\ j \neq i}}^N y_j\; , \qquad i = 1, \dots, N\; , 
\end{equation}
we says that the Bethe states are \emph{on-sheel}. In what follows, we will 
only consider \emph{off-shell} states. 

\subsubsection{Coordinate expansion}
From the map defined in~\cite{Wheeler:2010vmq}, we can associate to
each state \(\ket{\lambda}\), a Schur function \(s_\lambda(\vec{x})\),
where the dummy coordinates are \(\vec{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_N)\), with
\(N = \sum_{j=0}^M n_j\). Therefore, we can work in the ring of
symmetric functions \(\Lambda_M\), with basis given by Schur functions
\(s_\lambda\) and Young diagrams such that \(\max(\lambda_1) = M\),
and \(\max(\ell(\lambda)) = N\).

That also means that the operator \(B\) should also be realized in the
space \(\Lambda_M\), see~\cite{Tsilevich:2006}. The operators
\(\phi^\dagger_j\) and \(\phi_j\) are, respectively, \(1\)-particle
creation and annihilation at the site \(j\). In terms of partitions,
we can think of them as insertion and removal of a row of length
\(j\). That is, given the state \(\ket{\lambda} =\ket{1^{n_1} 2^{n_2}\cdots}\), 
we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \phi^\dagger_j \ket{\lambda} & = \ket{1^{n_1} 2^{n_2}\cdots j^{j+1}\cdots} \equiv \ket{\lambda \oplus (j)}\\
  \phi_j \ket{\lambda} & = \ket{1^{n_1} 2^{n_2}\cdots j^{j-1}\cdots}
  \equiv \ket{\lambda \ominus (j)}\; , 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Once again, we see that the case \(j=0\) is meaningless in the
partition construction. Given two partitions \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\),
we say that \(\lambda\) interlaces \(\mu\) if \(\lambda_i \geq \mu_i \geq \lambda_{i+1}\), 
and we write \(\lambda\succ \mu\). Therefore, it is easy to see that the partition 
\(\lambda\oplus (j)\) interlaces \(\lambda\), and \(\lambda\)
interlaces \(\lambda \ominus (j)\). We write this condition as 
\(\lambda \oplus (j) \succ \lambda \succ \lambda \ominus (j)\).

Now, we can use the explicit expression for the \(L\)-matrix to build
the monodromy matrix, and extract the operator \(B(x)\) as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  B(x)_a = T_a(x)_{12} = \sum_{j_1, \dots, j_M = 1,2} L_{a j_M}(x) L_{j_M j_{M-1}}(x)\cdots  L_{j_1 2}(x)\; ,
\end{equation}
and it is easy to see that it has the form  
\begin{equation}
  B(x) \equiv x^{-M/2} \mathbb{B}(x) = x^{-M/2} \sum_{k=0}^M x^k \mathcal{B}_k \; .
\end{equation}
The problem now is to find the action of the operators \(\mathcal{B}_k\) on
states \(\ket{\lambda}\).
\end{subequations}
Let us consider some simple cases.

\textbullet \ M=0: We have just one site in the  
chain, and all particles site at the site \(0\), as we have discussed many times, 
does not contribute to the partition representation.

\textbullet \ M=1: Now we have 1 row Young diagrams \(\lambda = (1^{n_1})\), where each row
corresponds to a boson. It is easy to show that 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbb{B}_{M=1}(x) =  x \phi_1^\dagger + \phi_0^\dagger \; ,
\end{equation}
therefore, \(\mathcal{B}_0 = \phi_0^\dagger\) and  \(\mathcal{B}_1 = \phi_1^\dagger\). 
From this expression, we have 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{B}_0\ket{(1^{n_1})} = \ket{(1^{n_1})} \qquad  
  \mathcal{B}_1\ket{(1^{n_1})} = \ket{(1^{n_1+1})} \; .
\end{equation}
All in all, we conclude that 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbb{B}_{M=1}(x)\ket{\lambda}  =  \ket{\lambda} + x\ket{\lambda \oplus (1)} \;.
\end{equation}

\textbullet \ M=2: Now we have 2 row Young diagrams \(\lambda = (1^{n_1}2^{n_2})\).
Now, one can show that
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{B}_{M=2}(x) = x^2 \phi_2^\dagger + x \left( \phi_1^\dagger
  + \phi_2^\dagger \phi_1 \phi_0^\dagger \right) + \phi_0^\dagger \; ,
\end{equation}
therefore,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}_0 = \phi_0^\dagger \qquad 
\mathcal{B}_1 = \phi_1^\dagger + \phi_2^\dagger \phi_1 \phi_0^\dagger \qquad 
\mathcal{B}_2 = \phi_2^\dagger \; .
\end{equation}

Consequently. we find
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \mathcal{B}_0\ket{(1^{n_1}2^{n_2})} & = \ket{(1^{n_1} 2^{n_2})} \qquad  
  \mathcal{B}_1\ket{(1^{n_1}2^{n_2})} = \ket{(1^{n_1+1} 2^{n_2})} + \ket{(1^{n_1-1} 2^{n_2 + 1})} \\
  \mathcal{B}_2\ket{(1^{n_1}2^{n_2})} & = \ket{(1^{n_1}2^{n_2+1})}\; .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Observe that the action of the operator \(\mathbb{B}_k(x)\) on \(\ket{\lambda}\)
generates diagrams \(\ket{\mu}\) such that \(k = |\mu| - |\lambda|\). 
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{B}_{M=2}(x) \ket{\lambda}  =
  \sum_{\lambda \prec \mu \subseteq [2,\ell(\lambda) + 1]} x^{|\mu|-|\lambda|} \ket{\mu}\; .
\end{equation}

One can keep doing this game, and we reach to the general conclusion that 
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{B}(x) \ket{\lambda}  =
  \sum_{\lambda \prec \mu \subseteq [M,\ell(\lambda) + 1]} x^{|\mu|-|\lambda|} \ket{\mu}\; .
\end{equation}

Therefore, we conclude that the action of the operators
\(\mathcal{B}_k\) on \(\ket{\lambda}\) generates diagrams
\(\ket{\mu}\) that are obtained from \(\lambda\) by adding \(k\) boxes,
not in different columns. From the viewpoint of symmetric functions, this rule
is exactly the Pieri's rule~\cite{Macdonald:1998}, that states that
we have that
\begin{equation}
  s_{(k)} s_\lambda = \sum_{\mu \succ \lambda} s_\mu\;.
\end{equation}

Therefore, we have the map from the spin chain Hilbert space to the
ring of symmetric functions given by \(\imath : \mathcal{B}_k \mapsto
s_{(k)}\) where \(s_{(k)}\) is the Schur function with 1 row of length
\(k\).

\subsection{q-Bosons}
The Hamiltonian for the q-boson model is
given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{H} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=0}^M
  \left(b_n^\dagger b_{n+1} + b_n b_{n+1}^\dagger \right) + \bar{\mathcal{N}}\; ,
\end{equation}
where \(\bar{\mathcal{N}} = \sum_{i=0}^M \mathcal{N}_i\), and as in
the case of the phase mode, we impose periodic boundary conditions
\(b_{M+1} = b_0\) and \(b_{M+1}^\dagger = b_0^\dagger\). The set of
operators \(\{b_i, b^\dagger,\mathcal{N}_i\}_{i=0}^M\) form the
\(M+1\) copies of independent q-boson algebras:
\begin{equation}
[\mathcal{N}_i, b_j^\dagger]=\delta_{i,j} b_i^\dagger\; , \quad 
[\mathcal{N}_i, b_j]=-\delta_{i,j}b_i\; , \quad
[B_i, B_j^\dagger]= \delta_{i,j} q^{-2\mathcal{N}_i}  \equiv \delta_{i,j} Q^{\mathcal{N}_i}\; , 
\end{equation}
where we write the deformation parameter as \(Q = q^{-2}\). 
In the limit \(Q\to 1\), the q-bosons are ordinary bosons, and 
the limit \(Q\to 0\) (\(q\to \infty\)) gives the phase model we have discussed above. 

\subsubsection{Representation}
We build the representation of the q-boson algebra with some modifications of the phase 
model we have just discussed. We suppose that the action of the operators \(\{b_i, b_i^\dagger\}\) 
satisfies 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{3}
    & b_0\ket{n_0} =(1 - \delta_{0, n_0}) \frac{1 - Q^{n_0}}{(1 - Q)^{1/2}}\ket{n_0 - 1}
    &\hspace{0.5cm}& b_0^\dagger \ket{n_0} =  \frac{1}{(1 - Q)^{1/2}}\ket{n_0 + 1}  \\
    & b_i\ket{n_i} = \frac{(1 - \delta_{0, n_i})}{(1 - Q)^{1/2}}\ket{n_i - 1}
    && b_i^\dagger \ket{n_0} =  \frac{(1 - Q^{n_i+1})}{(1 - Q)^{1/2}}\ket{n_0 + 1}\quad i\neq 0
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
where the modes \(\{b_0, b_0^\dagger \}\) satisfies a slightly different relation.

\subsubsection{Bethe Ansatz}
The \(L\)-operator for the q-boson is given by
\begin{equation}
  L_n(x, Q) =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    x^{-1/2} & (1 - Q)^{1/2} b_n^\dagger \\ (1 - Q)^{1/2} b_n & x^{1/2}
  \end{pmatrix}\; .
\end{equation}
The monodromy matrix is 
\begin{equation}
  T_a(x,Q) = L_{am}(x, q)  \dots  L_{a0}(x, q) = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    A(x) & B(x) \\ C(x) & D(x)
  \end{pmatrix}\; .
\end{equation}

The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are of the form
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi(y_1, \dots, y_N; Q)} = \prod_{j=1}^N B(y_j, Q) \ket{\bm{0}}\qquad 
  \bra{\Psi(y_1, \dots, y_N; Q)} = \bra{\bm{0}}\prod_{j=1}^N C(y_j, Q) \; .
\end{equation}
When the set \(\{ y_j \ | \ j =1, \dots , N\}\) satisfies the Bethe equations 
\begin{equation}
  y^{N + M}_i =\prod_{\substack{j = 1 \\ j \neq i}}^N\frac{Q y_i - y_j}{y_i - Q y_j}\; , \qquad i = 1, \dots, N\; , 
\end{equation}
Once again, we will consider \emph{off-shell} Bethe states.

\section{Toda tau functions and the phase model}
%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*

Bogoliubov~\cite{Bogoliubov2005}, in the notation~\cite{Wheeler:2010vmq},
has shown that the the scalar product of two vectors in the
\(N\)-particles sector in a chain of length \(M + 1\) is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:scalar}
  S(N, M|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) & =
  \bra{\bm{0}} \prod_{j=1}^N \mathbb{C}(x_j) \prod_{j=1}^N \mathbb{B}(y_j) \ket{\bm{0}} \\ 
 & = \frac{ \det H(\bm{x},\bm{y})}{ \prod_{i<j}(x_i - x_j)(y_i - y_j)} \; ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where \(H\) is an \(N\times N\) matrix with components
\begin{equation}
  H_{ij} = H(x_i, y_j) 
  =\frac{1 - (x_i y_j)^{ M + N}}{1 - x_i y_j }\; .
\end{equation}

This scalar product is related to the counting of plane
partitions, with
\begin{equation}
 S(N, M| \bm{x}, \bm{y}) 
 = \sum_{\lambda \subseteq (N, N, M)} s_{\lambda}(\bm{x}) s_{\lambda} (\bm{y})\; .
\end{equation}
In the limit \(M, N \to \infty\), one can use the Cauchy identity
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{\lambda } s_{\lambda}(\bm{x}) s_{\lambda}(\bm{y})
  = \prod_{i,j>0} \frac{1}{1- x_iy_j}\; ,
\end{equation}
and specialize this expression to \( x_i = y_i = q^{i-1/2} \) to find
the MacMahon function
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{\lambda } s_{\lambda}(\bm{q}_\star) s_{\lambda}(\bm{q}_\star) = \prod_{i,j>0} \frac{1}{1- q^{i +j -1}}\; ,
\end{equation}
where \(\bm{q}_{\star} = (q^{1/2}, q^{3/2}, \dots)\).

\subsection{KP and Toda tau functions}

Wheeler has shown in~\cite{Wheeler:2010vmq} that the the scalar
product~(\ref{eq:scalar}) is a KP tau function with respect to the
Miwa coordinates \(t_m = \frac{1}{m}\sum_j x_j^m\) (\(t'_m =
\frac{1}{m}\sum_j y_j^m\)), where the Schur functions
\(s_{\lambda}(\bm{y}) = c_\lambda\) ( \(s_{\lambda}(\bm{x}) =
c'_\lambda\)) become Plücker coordinates, and vice-versa.
The proof for this statement is relies on the map \(\mathcal{M}_\psi\)
between the space \(\mathcal{V}\) os Bethe states and Fock
space \(\mathcal{F}_\psi\) of free fermions. 

In fact, there is an easier way to see this fact. First one may see that 
\begin{equation}
 S(N,M,\bm{y}|\{\bm{t}\}) 
 = \sum_{\lambda} s_\lambda(\bm{y})  s_\lambda(\bm{t}) 
 \equiv \sum_{\lambda} c_\lambda(\bm{y})  s_\lambda(\bm{t}) 
\end{equation}
is a tau function of the KP hierarchy, since
\(c_\lambda(\bm{y}) = \det (h_{\lambda_i-i +j}(\bm{y}))\) are Plücker
coordinates~\cite{Miwa2000, Foda:2009zz}. Therefore, the truncation
\begin{equation}
 S(N,M,\bm{y}|\{\bm{t}\}) 
 = \sum_{\lambda \subseteq [N, \infty)} s_\lambda(\bm{y})  s_\lambda(\bm{t}) 
\end{equation}
is also a tau function. According to~\cite{Alexandrov:2012tr,
  Kharchev:1991gd, Zabrodin:2010ii}, the truncation of the tau
function corresponds to the inclusion of a projection operator
\(\mathrm{P}^+\) in the expectation value of the tau function.
% See section 3.3.2 of~\cite{Alexandrov:2012tr}, 

\subsubsection{Scalar product}
We also argue that this is also a tau function of the 2D toda hierarchy. 
We can write the Cauchy's identity as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{\lambda } s_{\lambda}(\bm{t}) s_{\lambda}(\bm{t}')
    = \exp \left( \sum_{m\geq1} m t_m t'_m \right) \; .
\end{equation}
where \(\bm{t}\) and \(\bm{t}'\) are two independent sets of Miwa coordinates.
It is a trivial tau function of the 2D Toda hierarchy, since one can write it as
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\lambda } s_{\lambda}(\bm{t}) s_{\lambda}(\bm{t}')
 = \bra{\bm{0}} e^{\bm{J}_+(\bm{t})} e^{-\bm{J}_-(\bm{t}')} \ket{\bm{0}}
\end{equation}
and from the free-fermions representation of the tau functions,
see~\cite{Alexandrov:2012tr}, we have that it is a tau function of the
Toda hierarchy with trivial element \(1 \in GL(\infty)\).
\end{subequations}

Therefore, the truncation 
\begin{equation}
 S(N,M|\{\bm{t}\},\{\bm{t}'\}) = 
  \sum_{\lambda \subseteq [N,N,M]} s_{\lambda}(\bm{t}) s_{\lambda}(\bm{t}')
\end{equation}
is a also a restricted tau function. These proofs follow from simple
properties of tau functions, and it should be contrated with the rich
formalism in~\cite{Wheeler:2010vmq}. Moreover, from~\cite{Zabrodin:2010ii}
we have that the this tau function can be written as the matrix integral
\begin{equation}
  S(N,M|\{\bm{t}\}, \{\bm{t}'\}) =
  \frac{1}{N!} \prod_{\ell=1}^N \oint_{\Gamma_\ell} \frac{dz_\ell}{2 \pi i z_\ell}
  e^{\xi_+(\bm{t}_+, z_\ell) - \xi_-(\bm{t}_-, z_{\ell}^{-1})} \Delta(z)\Delta(z^{-1})
\end{equation}

When the Bethe equations are satisfied, we have that \(x_j = y_j = e^{ip_j}\),
therefore \(t_{-m} = - t_m^\star\), and the the phase model is equivalent to
an ensemble of \(N\) 2D Coulomb particles on a circle. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsubsection{Correlation functions}
Bogoliubov has also shown that the correlation functions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  P(m|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \bra{0} \prod_{j=1}^N C(x) \prod_{j=1}^{N-1} B(y) \phi_m^\dagger \ket{0}
\end{equation}
can be written as
\begin{equation}
  P(m|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \frac{(-1)^{N-1}}{(\sqrt{y_N}^{N-1}}
  \left( \prod_{t<N} \frac{x_N - y_t}{y_t} \right) \frac{\det Q}{\det H} S(N,M|\bm{x}, \bm{y})
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where the \(N\times N\) matrix \(Q\) has components 
\begin{equation}
 Q_{jN} = x_j^{(M + N - 1- 2m)/2} \quad  \textrm{and} \quad 
 Q_{jk} = H_{jk} \; , 
\end{equation}
where \(H_{jk} = H(x_j, y_k)\) are the components of the matrix \(H\). 
Since the components \(Q_{jN}\) are independent of the coordinates \(y\), 
we cannot write the above expression in terms of a Toda hierarchy tau
function. 

We already know that 
\begin{equation}
   S(N,M|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) =  \Delta(x) \Delta(y) \det H \; ,
\end{equation}
therefore we define
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{P}(m|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) =\frac{\det Q}{\Delta(x)}\; ,
\end{equation}
and we are going to treat the coordinates \(\{ \bm{y} \}\) as
a set of \(N\) fixed constants, in a such a way that we write \(N\)
functions \(\bm{F}(z) = (F_1, \dots, F_N)\) defined as
\begin{equation}
  F_j (z) = H(z, y_j) \quad \textrm{if} \ j \neq N\; , \qquad \textrm{and}\qquad 
   F_N (z)  = z^{(M + N - 1 - 2m)/2} 
\end{equation}
Moreover, we have that
\begin{equation}
  H(z, y_j) = \frac{1 - (y_j z)^{M + N}}{1 - y_j z} = \sum_{n=0}^{N + M - 1} (y_j z)^n\; , 
\end{equation}
therefore, we write
\begin{equation}
  F_j(z) =  \sum_{n=0}^{M + N -1} f_{j, n} z^n
\end{equation}
where we will also assume the \(M + N \in 2 \mathbb{Z}\). With these definitions,
we conclude that
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{P}(m|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) =\frac{\det_{jk} F_j(x_k)}{\Delta(x)}\; ,
\end{equation}
and we write~\cite{Takasaki:2010qm}, 
\begin{equation}
  \det_{jk} F_j(x_k) = \det_{jk} \left(  \sum_{n=0}^{M + N -1} f_{j, n} x_k^n \right) \; .
\end{equation}
With the aid of the Cauchy-Binet formula, we write  
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{P}(m|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \sum_{0\leq \ell_N\leq \dots \leq \ell_1 \leq N+M}
  \frac{\det_{jk}(f_{j, \ell_k}) \det_{jk}(x_k^{\ell_j})}{\Delta(x)}\; ,
\end{equation}
and from the definition of the Schur polynomials and the
Jacobi-Trudi expression of Plücker coordinates, we can write this last
expression as 
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{P}(m|\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \sum_{\lambda} c_\lambda(\bm{y}) s_\lambda(\bm{x}) \; ,
\end{equation}
where \(c_\lambda(f_{j, \ell_k})\),  \(\ell_k = \lambda_k - k +N\), define point
in the finite dimensional Grassmannian manifold \(\mathrm{Gr}(N, N+M)\).

\subsubsection{Not everything is a tau-function}
It is also worth noticing that not everything is a tau function. Consider the state
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\mathcal{Y}} =
 \sum_{\vec{n}} \prod_{j=0}^M \ket{n_j}\quad \sum_j n_j = N\; .
\end{equation}
We have~\cite{Bogoliubov2005} the correlation function 
\begin{equation}
  \prod_{j=1}^N x^{M/2} \bra{\mathcal{Y}} \prod_{j=1}^N B(\bm{x}) \ket{\bm{0}} = 
  \sum_{\lambda\subseteq (N,N,M)} s_\lambda(\bm{x})\; . 
\end{equation}
This sum of Schur polynomials are not tau functions of the KP hierarchy.

We can easily see this fact, if we consider the the Fermionic
construction. Since
\begin{equation}
\tau(\bm{t}) = \bra{\bm{0}} e^{\bm{J}_+(\bm{t})} G \ket{\bm{0}}
\end{equation}
where \(G\in GL(\infty)\), and 
\begin{equation}
  \bra{\bm{0}} e^{\bm{J}_+(\bm{t})} = \sum_\lambda \bra{\mu} s_\lambda(\bm{t})\; , 
\end{equation}
therefore
\begin{equation}
\tau(\bm{t}) = \sum_{\lambda} \bra{\lambda} G \ket{\bm{0}} s_\lambda(\bm{t})
\end{equation}
and we need \(1 = \bra{\lambda} G \ket{\bm{0}} \). Then, 
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi_0} = G\ket{\bm{0}} = \sum_\lambda \ket{\lambda}\; ,
\end{equation}
is a coherent state, and we conclude that
\begin{equation}
G = 1 +  \sum_{d\geq 1} \prod_{j=1}^d \psi^\star_{a_j} \psi_{-b_j}\ \notin \ GL(\infty) \;. 
\end{equation}
It is interesting to notice that this state appears as the ground
state of the crystal melting problem in~\cite{Dijkgraaf:2008ua}.

Therefore, the restriction for diagrams with \(\ell(\lambda_1) \leq N\) is
not a tau function either.

\section{Scalar products for the Q-bosons}

Here I would like to start considering the q-boson problem. It has
been shown~\cite{Wheeler:2010vmq, Sulkowski:2008mx, Tsilevich:2006}
that the scalar product of two off-shell Bethe states in the q-boson
model is given by
\begin{equation}
S_Q(N,M | \bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \bra{\bm{0}} \prod_{j=1}^N C(x_j, Q)
\prod_{k=1}^N B(y_k, Q) \ket{\bm{0}}
= \sum_{\lambda \subseteq
  (N,N,M)} b_\lambda(Q) P_{\lambda}(\bm{x}, Q) P_{\lambda}(\bm{y}, Q)
\end{equation}
where \(P_\lambda\) denote the Hall-Littlewood polynomials.

It turns out that this expansion is  also related to the Cauchy identity for 
Hall-Littlewood polynomials~\cite{Macdonald:1998}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\lambda} b_\lambda(Q) P_{\lambda}(\bm{x}, Q) P_{\lambda}(\bm{y}, Q)
= \prod_{j, k=1}^\infty \frac{1-Q x_j y_k}{1 - x_j y_k}\; ,
\end{equation}
and using the results in~\cite[see chap.3, sec. 4, eq. (4.7)]{Macdonald:1998}, 
we can expand this identity as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cachy-hl}
 \prod_{j, k=1}^\infty \frac{1-Q x_j y_k}{1 - x_j y_k} = 
\sum_{\lambda} S_{\lambda}(\bm{x}, Q) s_{\lambda}(\bm{y}) =
\sum_{\lambda} S_{\lambda}(\bm{y}, Q) s_{\lambda}(\bm{x}) \; ,
\end{equation}
where the polynomials, the big-Schur~\cite{Wheeler:2018}, are given by 
a Jacobi-Trudi formula
\begin{equation}
  S_{\lambda} (\bm{y}, Q) = \det(q_{\lambda_i -i + j}(\bm{y}, Q))\; , 
\end{equation}
and the coefficients \(q_m\) can be obtained from the following expression
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{m} q_m(\bm{y}, Q) z^m =
 \prod_{j} \frac{1-Q y_j z}{1 - y_j z}
\end{equation}
where \(z\) is a formal variable. It has been argued
in~\cite{Foda:2008hn} that if we interpret the \(Q\)-Schur functions
as Plücker coordiantes, the identity~(\ref{eq:cachy-hl}) is a KP-tau
function.

Therefore, we see that the scalar product 
\begin{equation}
  S_Q(N,M | \bm{x}, \bm{y})
  = \sum_{\lambda \subseteq (N,N,M)} S_{\lambda}(\bm{x}, Q) s_{\lambda}(\bm{y})
  = \sum_{\lambda \subseteq (N,N,M)} S_{\lambda}(\bm{y}, Q) s_{\lambda}(\bm{x})\; ,
\end{equation}
is a restricted KP tau function with respect to both set of coordinates,
that is \(\bm{x}\) and \(\bm{y}\).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Supersymmetric Schur polynomials}

Let us also decompose 
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{m} q_m(\bm{y}, Q) z^m =
 \prod_j (1 + y_j (-Q z)) \prod_k (1 - y_k z)^{-1} = 
 \sum_{j, k} e_j(\bm{y}) h_k(\bm{y}) (- Q)^j z^{j+k}\; .
\end{equation}
And reorganizing this sum, we conclude that 
\begin{equation}
  q_m(\bm{y}, Q)  = \sum_{j=0}^m e_j(\bm{y}) h_{m-j}(\bm{y}) (- Q)^j =
 \sum_{j=0}^m e_j(-Q\bm{y}) h_{m-j}(\bm{y}) \; ,
\end{equation}
where in the last equality we have used the homogeneity of the elementary symmetric polynomials,
and \( -Q\bm{y} = (-Qy_1, -Qy_2, \dots)\). 

%One can also define the set of coordinates \(\bm{\xi} =
%\{\xi_i(\bm{x}, Q)\}\), in such a way that
%\begin{equation}
% \sum_{m} q_m(\bm{x}, Q) z^m := \sum_{m} h_m(\bm{\xi}) z^m =
% \prod_k \frac{1}{(1 - \xi_k z)} \;.
%\end{equation}
%In this sense, the \(Q\)-Schur function is an ordinary Schur function
%with respect the variables \(\bm{\xi}\).

It is easier to consider the following expansions 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \prod_{j=1}^N (1 - (Q y_i)z) & = \prod_{j=1}^N e^{ \ln  (1 - (Q y_i)z)} = 
    \prod_{j=1}^N \exp \left( - \sum_{n>0} \frac{Q^n y^n_j}{n} z^n \right) \\ 
    & = \exp \left( - \sum_{n>0} \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{Q^n y^n_j}{n} z^n \right)  =
    \exp \left( - \sum_{n>0} t^{(Q)}_n z^n \right)  
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where \(t^{(Q)}_n = \frac{Q^n}{n} \sum_j y_j^n = Q^n t'_n\), and 
\begin{equation}
    \prod_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{(1 - y_iz)} = \prod_{j=1}^N e^{- \ln  (1 - y_iz)} = 
    \prod_{j=1}^N \exp \left( \sum_{n>0} \frac{y_j}{n} z^n \right)=
    \exp \left(\sum_{n>0} t_n z^n \right) \; . 
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Therefore 
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{m} q_m(\bm{y}, Q) z^m =
 \prod_j \frac{1 + y_j (-Q z)}{1 - y_k z}
 = \exp \left( \sum_{n\geq 1} (t'_n - t_n^{(Q)})z^n \right)
 \equiv \exp \left( \sum_{n\geq 1} T_n z^n \right)\; ,
\end{equation}
with \(T_n = (1 - Q^n) t'_n\). Then, we conclude that \(q_m(\bm{y}, Q)\)
are homogeneous polynomials with respect the Miwa coordinates
\(\bm{T} = (T_1, T_2, \dots)\). All in all, we conclude that 
\begin{equation}
  S_\lambda(\bm{t}', Q) = \det \left(h_{\lambda_i - i +j}(\bm{T})\right) = s_\lambda(\bm{T})\; .
\end{equation}

Supersymmetric Schur functions, see~\cite{Zinnjustin2009}, \(s_\lambda(\bm{\alpha}/\bm{\beta})\)
are defined as ordinary schur functions evaluated at Miwa coodinates
of the form
\begin{equation}
  T_n = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{\dim(\alpha)} \alpha_i^n
       - \sum_{i=1}^{\dim(\beta)} (-\beta_i)^n\right)\; ,
\end{equation}
and comparing with the results above, we can see that the big Schur functions
\(S_\lambda(\bm{t}', Q)\)\; , is the supersymmetric Schur functions for \(\bm{\alpha} = \bm{y}\) 
and \(\bm{\beta} = - Q \bm{y}\), that is 
\begin{equation}
  S_\lambda(\bm{t}', Q) = s_\lambda[\bm{y}/(- Q\bm{y})]\; .
\end{equation}

Putting these facts together, we immediately conclude that since 
\begin{equation}
  \sum_\lambda s_\lambda(\bm{T}) s_\lambda (\bm{t}) \; ,
\end{equation}
is a Toda hierarchy tau function, we obviously have that 
\begin{equation}
  S_Q(N,M| \bm{x}, \bm{y}) \equiv S_Q(N,M| \bm{t}, \bm{T})
  = \sum_{\lambda \subseteq [N,N,M]} s_\lambda(\bm{T}) s_\lambda(\bm{t})\; , 
\end{equation}
is also a restricted tau function of the Toda hierarchy.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Toda hierarchy}

One of the greatest advantages of the expressions above is that we do not 
need to consider the t-Schur fermions.

It would be very interesting to have some basic understanding of what
is happenning in the fermionic representation of this tau function.
Let us expand these polynomials in a Schur polynomials basis, that is
\begin{equation}
P_\lambda(\bm{x}, Q) = \sum_{\mu} K^{-1}_{\lambda \mu}(Q) s_\lambda(\bm{x})\; , 
\end{equation}
where \(K^{-1}_{\mu\nu}(Q) \in \mathbb{Z}[Q]\) are inverse
Kostka–Foulkes coefficients, and \(K^{-1}_{\lambda\mu} = 0 \) if
\(|\lambda|\neq |\mu|\)~\cite{Macdonald:1998, Wheeler:2018}.

Expanding now the \(Q\)-Schur functions as
\begin{equation}
  S_\lambda(\bm{x}, Q) = \sum_{\mu} c_{\lambda\mu}(Q) s_\mu(\bm{x})\; ,
\end{equation}
we can fix the coefficients \(c_{\lambda\mu}\) in terms of Kostka-Foulkes
polynomials as follows. Since~\cite{Macdonald:1998} 
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{b_\mu}\langle P_\mu(\bm{x}, Q), P_\mu(\bm{x}, Q)\rangle = \langle
  S_\mu(\bm{x}, Q), s_\mu(\bm{x})\rangle = \delta_{\mu\nu}\; ,  
\end{equation}
we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
\delta_{\mu\nu} & = \sum_\lambda c_{\mu\lambda}  \langle s_\lambda(\bm{x}), s_\mu(\bm{x})\rangle\\
& = \sum_\lambda \sum_{\pi_1, \pi_2} c_{\mu\lambda}  K_{\lambda \pi_1} K_{\mu \pi_2}
\langle P_{\pi_1}(\bm{x}, Q), P_{\pi_2}(\bm{x}, Q)\rangle \\ 
& = \sum_\lambda \sum_{\pi} c_{\mu\lambda} b_{\mu}^{-1}  K_{\lambda \pi} K_{\mu \pi}\; ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
and we conclude that 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:indices}
c_{\mu \nu} = \sum_\pi K_{\mu\pi}^{-1} b_\mu (K_{\nu\pi}^{-1})^T\; .
\end{equation}
\marginpar[left]{\tiny Fix these \\ indices later.}

Hence, we conclude that 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\mu} S_{\mu}(\bm{x},Q) s_{\nu}(\bm{y}) = 
\sum_{\mu , \nu} c_{\mu\nu} s_{\mu}(\bm{x}) s_{\nu}(\bm{y}) 
\end{equation}
and everything boils down to the analysis of the
indices~(\ref{eq:indices}).

Do they satisfy Plücker relations? We already know that the
big Schur functions themselves are KP-tau
functions, see also~\cite{Necoechea:2019wbg}, therefore, the coefficients
\((c_\lambda)_\mu \equiv c_{\lambda\mu}\) must satisfy Plücker relations
for the KP hierarchy.

From the above considerations, we can define 2 set of functions \(F_i(x)\) and
\(G_i(y)\) such that
\begin{equation}
 F_i(x) = \sum_{n} F_{i,n} x^n \qquad 
 G_i(y) = \sum_{n} G_{i,n} y^n\; ,
\end{equation}
in such a way that 
\begin{equation}
  c_{\mu\nu} = \det(F_{i, m_j} | G_{i, n_k})\; ,
\end{equation}
and we conclude that the scalar product is, indeed, a Toda tau function. 
\marginpar[left]{\tiny Improve this\\ discussion}

\subsection{!! Fermionic construction}

Let us now consider the fermionic construction of this tau function. We write 
the limit \(N,M\to \infty\) of the scalar product
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
  S_Q(\bm{T}, \bm{t}') = \sum_{\mu} s_\mu(\bm{T}) s_\mu(\bm{t}')
\end{equation}
that is quite quite trivial from the viewpoint of the free fermion construction, 
\begin{equation}
  S_Q(\bm{T}, \bm{t}') = \bra{\bm{0}} e^{\bm{J}_+(\bm{T})} e^{\bm{J}_-(\bm{t}')} \ket{\bm{0}}\; .
\end{equation}

Moreover, we also know that
\begin{equation}
  S_Q(\bm{t}, \bm{t}') = \sum_{\mu\nu} c_{\mu\nu} s_\mu(\bm{t}) s_\mu(\bm{t}')
\end{equation}
where \(n t = \sum_j x^n_j\) and \(n t' = \sum_j y^n_j\) are Miwa coordinates, then  
\begin{equation}
  S_Q(\bm{t}, \bm{t}') = \bra{\bm{0}} e^{J_+(\bm{t})} G_Q  e^{J_-(\bm{t}')} \ket{\bm{0}}
\end{equation}
and \(G_Q \in GL(\infty)\) that depends on \(Q\). We could also think of \(G_Q\)
as a twist
\(G_Q = e^{Q H} G e^{-Q H}\), with the action of \(H\in \mathfrak{gl}(\infty)\)
on ordinary fermions generating the Q-fermions. 
\marginpar[left]{\tiny Investigate this\\ twists}
\end{subequations}

It seems that we have some different representations for this tau function, 
and it is worth investigating what is happening here. That is what we want 
to do now.
